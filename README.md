<h1>JS Weather</h1>
<h2>HTML5 and Javascript Geolocation Weather Forecasting Application</h2>

<p>Simple application which uses browser-based geolocation to provide current weather conditions.</p>
<p>Tends to work better on GPS-enabled devices.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>Requires a web server to work properly. In other words, this program will not run if opened as a local file in a web browser.</p>
<p>Fix: Open a terminal window in the same directory where you've cloned this repo, then run a simple HTTP server in the same directory. Then open the file. Should work with no problems.</p>
<p>If you have python installed (installed by default on OS X), simply run python -m SimpleHTTPServer in the directory of this file.</p>
